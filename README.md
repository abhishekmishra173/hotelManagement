The Hotel Management System is a web-based application designed to simplify and automate hotel operations such as room booking, customer management, check-in/check-out tracking, and billing. Developed using HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap, the system offers a responsive and visually appealing interface that works seamlessly across desktops, tablets, and mobile devices. It allows hotel staff to efficiently manage guest details, track room availability in real time, and handle the complete booking process from reservation to payment. The systemâ€™s modular structure makes it easy to add new features such as database integration, user authentication, or advanced reporting in the future. With its clean UI, intuitive navigation, and scalability, this project is ideal for small to medium-sized hotels or as a learning project for beginners exploring web development and hospitality management solutions.
